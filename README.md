# Image Processing Project

## Overview

This project implements a fuzzy edge detection algorithm and image enhancement techniques using Python and various libraries. The algorithm includes gradient computation, fuzzy edge detection, and image sharpening. Additionally, a membership function is employed to handle fuzzy logic in the edge detection process. The goal is to showcase the application of fuzzy logic in edge detection and demonstrate the enhancement of image details.

## Features

- Grayscale conversion of images.
- Computation of horizontal and vertical gradients using Sobel-like filters.
- Fuzzy edge detection based on gradient magnitudes and a threshold.
- Incorporating a membership function to handle fuzzy logic during the edge detection process
- Image enhancement through unsharp masking for improved details.

## Results
Visualizations of the original image, grayscale image, gradients, fuzzy edge detection, and enhanced image are provided below.
